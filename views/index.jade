			.header MEAN Stack Workshop (2-3:30 pm)
			.subject The MEAN Stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Nodejs)
			.detail We are teaming up with MongoDB (
				a(href='https://twitter.com/mongodbinc' target='_blank')@mongodbinc
				) to put on this afternoon workshop led by Valeri Karpov on the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular and Node.js). MongoDB helps you build new applications, fast. By coding with Javascript throughout, engineers are able to realize performance gains in both the software itself and in the productivity of developers. See how you can leverage MongoDB and Node.js for rapid application development with powered end-to-end Javascript. Spots are limited, reserve your spot now!

			.subject Build and Deploy an API server in Node
			.detail In this workshop, Matt Schmulen will walk you through the fundamentals of how an API Server works and what they are good for. We'll then crack open our lids and start hacking. By the end of the session you should have an API Server deployed locally or on your cloud of choice that supports connectivity to MongoDB, MySQL and Oracle plus provides services like push, geolocation and sync.

			.subject Strongloop: Beyond Node v0.12 - Functional Gaps, Solutions and Unicorns
			.detail In this talk, Node core committer Bert Belder looks beyond Node v0.12 to discuss the functional gaps that still remain, plus a preview of a few potential solutions. He'll also make the case that Node is coming to a browser near you - whether you like it or not. This should create a full circle JavaScript utopia. Unicorns!

			.subject Integrate All The Things!
			.detail Adam Tuttle will talk about using Node and Heroku to make his life easier and more enjoyable. As more and more of everyday life becomes internet-addressable, it becomes possible to automate the tediousness out of life. There are a million great SaaS tools, but for the most part they all exist in their own silos. Thanks to service webhooks and APIs, and the proliferation of Node modules, you can aggregate most things into a life-stream... and you can host these tools in the cloud, for free, on Heroku. It's like IFTTT, but with more control and a better interface: your IDE.
